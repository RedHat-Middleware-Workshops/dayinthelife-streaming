[id='change-data-capture']
= {title}

One of the challenges of acquisitions is the integration between systems. You are now part of the team that needs to integrate the enterprise systems of International Inc, with the cloud native infrastructure of Fleur de Lune. You will use the Debezium Change Data Capture connector to emit events from a legacy application to replicate orders data to the new Apache Kafka clusters.

In the first part of this lab you will use the already enabled Change Data Capture (CDC) for a legacy application that loads the customer orders from a comma separated value (CSV) file. This old PHP application can’t be modified so there is no way to modernize it without risks. You will use CDC on the SQL server database where the orders are stored and the connector deployed on the Kafka Connect cluster using AMQ streams to emit data change events.

*Audience:* Enterprise Integrators, System Architects, Developers, Data Integrators

*Overview*

Apache Kafka is the de facto standard for asynchronous event propagation between microservices. Things get challenging, though, when adding a service’s database to the picture: how can you avoid inconsistencies between Kafka and the database?

Enter Change Data Capture (CDC) and Debezium.

image::images/debezium-cdc.png[Debezium CDC]

By capturing changes from the log files of the database, Debezium gives you both reliable and consistent inter-service messaging via Kafka and instant read-your-own-write semantics for services themselves.

*Why Red Hat?*

To respond to business demands quickly and efficiently, you need a way to integrate applications and data spread across your enterprise. Red Hat® AMQ—based on open source communities like Apache ActiveMQ and Apache Kafka—is a flexible messaging platform that delivers information reliably, enabling real-time integration and connecting the Internet of Things (IoT).

AMQ streams component makes Apache Kafka “OpenShift native” through the use of powerful operators that simplify the deployment, configuration, management, and use of Apache Kafka on OpenShift.

image::images/openshift-kafkaconnect-detail.png[OpenShift Kafka Resource, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

=== Configure KafkaConnect CDC Connector

When you have created a container image for your connector plug-in, you need to create a connector instance in your Kafka Connect cluster. You can then configure, monitor, and manage a running connector instance.

AMQ Streams provides two APIs for creating and managing connectors:

* KafkaConnector resources (referred to as KafkaConnectors)
* Kafka Connect REST API

*KafkaConnectors* allow you to create and manage connector instances for Kafka Connect in an OpenShift-native way, so an HTTP client such as cURL is not required. Like other Kafka resources, you declare a connector’s desired state in a *KafkaConnector* _YAML_ file that is deployed to your OpenShift cluster to create the connector instance.

. In the topology view, click *+Add* on the left menu.

. Click on the *From Catalog* option.

. Type in `kafka` in the search text field and then click on *Kafka connector*.
+
--
image::images/kafka-connector-resource.png[KafkaConnector Resource, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Double check that you are selecting *KafkaConnector* and not _KafkaConnect_. Notice the *or* at the end.
====
--

. Click on Create button.
+
image::images/kafka-connector-create.png[Create KafkaConnector, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Replace the contents of the YAML editor with the following code:

== Loading Earth Orders

It's now time to test the Change Data Capture integration.

- We will first load the CSV data into MSSQL using a PHP app
- Debezium will populate data from MSSQL into the Earth Kafka topic

Let's get started!

=== Loading Orders File

. Download to your local system the link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatWorkshops/dayinthelife-streaming/master/support/module-2/earth-orders.csv[Earth Orders File, window="_blank"].

. Navigate to the legacy PHP link:http://www-shared-app-earth.{openshift-app-host}/#{user-username}[Enterprise System, window="_blank"] in a new browser tab.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure that /#{user-username} is added at the end of the URL. You won't be able to load the file if your are missing this part.
====
+
image:images/www-main.png[PHP System]

. Click on the *Choose File* button to load the _orders_ file.
+
image:images/www-choose-file.png[Choose File]

. Load the _CSV_ file you just downloaded. Click on *Open* button.
+
image:images/www-orders-file.png[Orders File]

. Now, click the *Load File* button. This will load the file orders and insert them in the database.
+
image:images/www-load-file.png[Load File]

.  Wait a few seconds for the information to load. If this is successfully completed, you will see the CSV data on the *Imported Orders* page.
+
image::images/www-imported-orders.png[Imported Orders]

=== Check Database Records

After loading the file into the system, the orders data should be stored in the MSSQL Server database. Let's check to make sure that's the case.

. Go back to the topology view of the OpenShift Developer console. Change the project to the `shared-db-earth`.
+
image:images/openshift-change-project.png[Change Project]

. Click on the database deployment to open the overview page. Then click on the *Resources* tab and next the _Pod_ name.
+
image:images/openshift-db-overview.png[Access Pod]

. Now, click on the *Terminal* tab to access the pod's shell.
+
image:images/openshift-db-terminal.png[Pod Terminal]
+
[TIP]
====
If you feel comfortable, you can also use the OpenShift CLI command `oc rsh` to access the database pod as well.
====

. Run the following command to access the database:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S mssql-server-linux -U sa -P Password! -d InternationalDB -Q "select top 5 * from dbo.Orders where OrderUser='{user-username}'"
----

. Check the results, should look like this:
+
image::images/openshift-sqlcommand.png[Query]

=== Check Apache Kafka Records

We checked that the database had the _orders_ data. Is now time to check that the Change Data Capture connector was able to query the transaction log and generate the Apache Kafka events to the cluster.

. Go back to the topology view of the OpenShift Developer console. Change the project to the `shared-kafka-earth`.
+
image:images/openshift-project-sharedkafka.png[Change Project]

. Validate that the *KafkaTopics* were created.
+
- Expand the *More* menu on the left menu bar.
- Click on *Search* to load the _resources_ search page.
- Click on the _Resource Type_ field and type 'topic'.
- Finally check *KafkaTopic*.
+
image::images/openshift-search-kafkatopics.png[Search KafkaTopics]

. This will display the topics on the *Earth* _Kafka cluster_. You should be able to locate your `{user-username}-debezium-cluster*` as well as the `{user-username}.earth.dbo.orders--*` _KafkaTopics_.
+
image::images/openshift-cdc-topics.png[CDC KafkaTopics]
+
[TIP]
====
You can narrow the results by adding `{user-username}` to the search filter.
====

[type=verification]
Were you able to see that your Change Data Capture connector has access to Kafka?

{standard-fail-text}

=== Inspect Kafka records

Time to check what information is flowing into Apache Kafka.

. Go back to the topology view. We will access one of the Kafka brokers.

. Click on the `earth-cluster kafka` _stateful set_.

. Click on the *Resources* tab.

. Click on the `earth-cluster-kafka-0` pod to access the details.
+
image::images/openshift-kafka-deployment.png[Kafka Pods]

. Click on the *Terminal* tab to access this pod's shell.
+
image::images/openshift-kafka-terminal.png[Kafka Pods]
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Red Hat provides its own complete Apache Kafka distribution container images. We will use the `kafka-console-consumer.sh` script to query the topics.
====

. Issue the following command to read *all* the events in the `orders` topic:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic {user-username}.earth.dbo.Orders --from-beginning
----

. You should see the json output of the messages. Something like this:

[id="replicating-to-other-kafka-clusters"]
== Replicating to other Kafka clusters

We refer to the process of replicating data between Kafka clusters as "mirroring" to avoid confusion with the replication that happens amongst the nodes in a single cluster. Kafka comes with a tool for mirroring data between Kafka clusters.

The Cluster Operator deploys one or more Kafka Mirror Maker replicas to replicate data between Kafka clusters. The Mirror Maker consumes messages from the source cluster and republishes those messages to the target cluster. A common use case for this kind of mirroring is to provide a replica in another datacenter.

=== Deploy Mirror Maker

. Deploy the mirror maker cluster to _mirror_ the data from _Earth_ to _Moon_. (We mean from the Earth Kafka cluster to the Moon Kafka cluster)

. Go back to the OpenShift Developer console and click on *+Add* menu on the left side bar.
+
image:images/openshift-mirrormaker-add.png[Add From Topology]

. Click on the *From Catalog* option.
+
image::images/add-from-catalog.png[OpenShift From Catalog, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Type in `mirror` in the search text field and then click on *Kafka MirrorMaker*.

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
kind: KafkaMirrorMaker

    config:
      auto.offset.reset: earliest
  producer:
    bootstrapServers: 'moon-kafka-bootstrap.{user-username}.svc:9092'
  whitelist: {user-username}.earth.*
----

. Click on *Create* button.
+
image::images/openshift-mirromaker-detail.png[OpenShift Kafka Resource, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Wait for cluster to start.  It can take a few minutes as the operator will deploy your Kafka cluster infrastructure and related operators to manage it.
+
image:images/openshift-mirrormaker-topology.png[Mirror Maker Topology]

=== Review Mirrored Records

. Validate that the *KafkaTopics* were created.
+
--
. Expand the *More* menu on the left menu bar.

. Click on *Search* to load the _resources_ search page.

. Click on the _Resource Type_ field and type 'topic'.

. Finally check *KafkaTopic*.
--
+
image::images/openshift-moon-kafkatopics.png[Search KafkaTopics]

. This will display the topics on the *Moon* _Kafka cluster_. You should be able to locate your `{user-username}.earth.dbo.orders--*` _KafkaTopic_.

[id="enabling-http-access"]
== Enabling HTTP access to Kafka

Apache Kafka uses a custom protocol on top of TCP/IP for communication between applications and the cluster. There are many client implementations for different programming languages, from Java to Golang, from Python to C# and many more.

However, there are scenarios where it is not possible to use the clients, or indeed the native protocol. Communicating with an Apache Kafka cluster using a standard protocol like HTTP/1.1 eases development in these scenarios.

=== Deploy the HTTP Bridge Proxy

. Go back to the OpenShift Developer console and click on *+Add* menu on the left side bar.
+
image:images/openshift-mirrormaker-add.png[Add From Topology]

. Click on the *From Catalog* option.
+
image::images/add-from-catalog.png[OpenShift From Catalog, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Type in `kafka` in the search text field and then click on *Kafka Bridge*.
+
image::images/openshift-bridge-catalog.png[OpenShift HTTP Bridge, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Click on *Create* button.
+
image::images/openshift-bridge-create.png[OpenShift HTTP Bridge, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Create a `KafkaBridge` Kubernetes Resource to define your HTTP Bridge proxy. Replace the _YAML_ editor with the following code:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaBridge
metadata:
  name: http
spec:
  bootstrapServers: 'moon-kafka-bootstrap.{user-username}.svc:9092'
  http:
    port: 8080
  replicas: 1
----

. Click on *Create* button.
+
image::images/openshift-bridge-details.png[OpenShift Kafka Resource, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Wait for the bridge to start.
+
image:images/openshift-bridge-topology.png[Mirror Maker Topology]

. From the CodeReady terminal, expose the bridge HTTP REST API service as a route for external access.
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc expose service http-bridge-service --name kafka-bridge -n {namespace}
----

=== Test the HTTP Bridge

. Create a consumer to test the connection to your topic. Issue the following command from the terminal:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cat << EOF | curl -X POST http://kafka-bridge-{user-username}.{openshift-app-host}/consumers/{user-username}-http-group -H 'content-type: application/vnd.kafka.v2+json' -d @-
{
    "name": "{user-username}",
    "format": "json",
    "auto.offset.reset": "earliest",
    "enable.auto.commit": false,
    "fetch.min.bytes": 1024,
    "consumer.request.timeout.ms": 30000
}
EOF
----

. Notice the return json `base_uri`, it represents the REST resource for your consumer.
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
{"instance_id":"user1","base_uri":"http://kafka-bridge-{user-username}.apps.cluster-eventing-6fbb.eventing-6fbb.example.
opentlc.com:80/consumers/{user-username}-http-group/instances/{user-username}"}
----

. Use the previous **base_uri** to request subscription to the topics.
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl -X POST http://kafka-bridge-{user-username}.{openshift-app-host}/consumers/{user-username}-http-group/instances/{user-username}/subscription -H 'content-type: application/vnd.kafka.v2+json' -d '{"topics": ["{user-username}.earth.dbo.Orders"]}'
----

. Now you can start to consume some records. Notice that you need to send `json` as the accept type.
+

Were you able to successfully retrieve CDC data over HTTP?  *Congratulations!* You just finished capturing data from a MSSQL database into Kafka, then replicate that information to a different Kafka cluster. Finally you were able to retrieve the information using an HTTP interface.

== Summary

In this lab you used Debezium CDC connectors to react to change events from SQL Server and send them to Apache Kafka running on OpenShift through Red Hat AMQ streams.

Open source connectors enable integrations with your local systems landscape. Explore Kafka, Camel, and Debezium connectors to connect APIs and services for event-driven application architectures (EDA). Red Hat offers supported versions of these connectors via AMQ Streams and Fuse.

You can now proceed to link:{next-lab-url}[Lab 3].

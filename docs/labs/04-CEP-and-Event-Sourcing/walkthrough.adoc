= Lab 4 - Complex Event Processing and Event Sourcing

In this lab you will be applying two common scenarios to processing events: Event Sourcing and Complex Event Processing (CEP). First replaying the harvest data to estimate possible costs to operate farms on the moon. You will use Kafka Streams API for real-time events processing and extracting information from event streams as they arrive.

*Audience:* System Architects, Developers, Data Integrators

*Overview*

Event Sourcing is used to handle the sequence of imperative events. Events in AMQ Streams are stored and persisted sequentially, each representing change of state. This allows applications to replay history and experiment with what-if scenarios.

Complex Event Processing (CEP) is an event processing concept, with the goal of identifying the meaningful events within the event cloud.

*Why Red Hat?*

To respond to business demands quickly and efficiently, you need a way to integrate applications and data spread across your enterprise. Red Hat® AMQ—based on open source communities like Apache ActiveMQ and Apache Kafka—is a flexible messaging platform that delivers information reliably, enabling real-time integration and connecting the Internet of Things (IoT).

Red Hat Kafka Streams API is a client library for building applications and microservices, where the input and output data are stored in Kafka clusters. It combines the simplicity of writing and deploying standard Java and Scala applications on the client side with the benefits of Kafka's server-side cluster technology.

Kogito is the open source Quarkus extension that allows developers to implement core logic in a more business-driven way. It brings concepts and maturity from 15+ years of experience of production-tested projects like jBPM and Drools.

== Provision Simulator and AMQ Online Topic

=== Real time harvest information gathering
(Skip this task if you have already done so in other labs and go directly to the next Task)

You are setting up a topic in AMQ Online to receive event signals from Edge devices. In this task, you'll provision a messaging topic using Red Hat's Messaging as a Service platform on OpenShift (AMQ Online).

+
image::images/1.1.0-diagram-1.png[1.1.0-diagram, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

*Red Hat AMQ Online* is an OpenShift-based mechanism for delivering messaging as a managed service. With Red Hat AMQ Online, administrators can configure a cloud-native, multi-tenant messaging service where developers can provision messaging using a _web console_. Multiple development teams can provision the brokers and queues from the console, *without* requiring each team to _install, configure, deploy, maintain, or patch any software_.

== Summary

In this lab you replayed streams of events to see the possible analytical result of farm costs in order to better predict revenue. This is a common event streaming technique called Event sourcing. You have been introduced how to implement with ease using Camel-K and Red Hat AMQ Streams.

Event driven is also the foundation for real time behavior detection. You used Kafka Streams in conjunction with Kogito to build real time complex event processing app to detect if disaster strikes base on the harvest data.

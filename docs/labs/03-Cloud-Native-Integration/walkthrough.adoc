= Lab 3 - Cloud-Native Integration with EIPs

Your IT journey on International Inc has taken you to the Moon. Is now time to apply all your knowledge around Enterprise Integration to the IoT-based farming from Fleur de Lune. You will create a couple of microservices to help them get information regarding the harvest size, quality and shipping using the cloud-native framework of Apache Camel K.

*Audience:* Enterprise Integrators, System Architects, Developers, Data Integrators

*Overview*

Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIPs) have been used in technology for 40+ years.  But are they still relevant when we attempt Cloud-Native integration?

Patterns like the Splitter, Content-Based Routing (CBR) and WireTap are still very useful when it comes to managing and integrating our data in the cloud.  Using Camel K, we are able to enhance existing streaming technologies like Kafka to help route and mediate our data through various channels.

AMQ self-service messaging enables Developers to provision messaging when and where they need it via a web-based browser. The AMQ Online component is built on the foundation of Red Hat OpenShift, a container platform for high scalability and availability of cloud-native applications.

To provide a better customer experience, you will be closely monitoring the harvest from marshmallows farms on the moon. You will also be adding a harvest batch shipping schedule to allow Fleur de lune to be more proactive along with faster response to any emergency that may impact their business.

In this lab you will consume IoT events from an AMQ Online topic, use Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIPs) in Camel-K to split and route messages to a Datalake.  Lastly, you'll stream the messages to a Standard and Premium Shipping topic on Kafka.

*Why Red Hat?*

To solve complex cloud-native integration challenges, we need to apply EIPs to manage our data and messaging needs. Apache Camel K gives us a Kubernetes native EIP solution for tackling EIPs in the cloud.

By using Camel-K, we can enhance data streaming and apply traditional EIPs to solve cloud-native integration.

=== Create a Topic
*Red Hat AMQ Online* is an OpenShift-based mechanism for delivering messaging as a managed service. With Red Hat AMQ Online, administrators can configure a cloud-native, multi-tenant messaging service where developers can provision messaging using a _web console_. Multiple development teams can provision the brokers and queues from the console, *without* requiring each team to _install, configure, deploy, maintain, or patch any software_.


. In your {amqoneline-url}[AMQ Online Console, window="_blank", id="{context}-3"].a Click *amq* listed on the page this will take you to the

== Create the Simulator
. Since we can't really set up a real edge device for you on the moon, you will need to create a simulator that simulates the edge device that sends randomly generated harvest data.
+
image::images/1.1.0-diagram-2.png[1.1.0-diagram, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. In the Che workspace open the `FleurDeLune/projects/harvest/simulator` folder.
+
image::images/2.1.4-che-workspace-folder.png[2.1.4-che-workspace-folder, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Open the `edge.properties` file.  This is the *application.properties* file where all credentials are stored.  We need to update `quarkus.qpid-jms.url` for the **AMQP** endpoint.  Copy and paste the `serviceHost` you copied earlier (into a text editor) and update the `amqp://` endpoint with the correct service hostname.
+
image::images/2.1.5-edge-properties.png[2.1.5-edge-properties, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Go to the `dil-` terminal that was opened in the previous task (followed by a 5-digit alphanumeric code).

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc project {namespace}
cd /projects/FleurDeLune/projects/harvest/simulator
oc create configmap edge-config  --from-file=edge.properties
----

. Open the `EdgeSimulator.java` file located in the same folder.  We want to create a Camel Route that fires a timer every 5 seconds, retrieves some random data, marshalls it to JSON and sends it via AMQP to your AMQ Online **mytopic**.  Copy and paste the following Camel route to your EdgeSimulator.java file:
+
[source,java,subs="attributes+"]
----
from("timer:tick?fixedRate=true&period=5000")
.choice()
    .when(simple("{{simulator.run}}"))

. Now that we've populated the database table with records, navigate back to the *OpenShfit Dev Spaces* window and open the `FleurDeLune/projects/harvest/inventory` project.  Examine the `Inventory.java` file.  At this point we need to create 3 Camel routes.  A route to:
+
** Consume harvest JSON messages from AMQ Online, and using Content-based routing determine whether they are standard, premium or utility marshmallows.
** Insert premium marshmallow dimensions into the PREMIUM database table
** Insert standard marshmallow dimensions into the STANDARD database table

. Copy & paste the following Camel routes to the `Inventory.java` file:

oc apply -f shippingconsole-config.yaml
----

. Now that we have the configmap updated, take a look at **ConsoleService.java**.  Notice that we use Camel RESTDsl to expose a bunch of RESTFul queries around our infinispan cache.  Let's try running this interface using the following command:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
kamel run ConsoleService.java --dev
----

. Now that we have the Camel-K interface running, we can view the content in our Data Lake.  First, navigate here (in a new tab) to see the Standard shipments: `http://console-service-{user-username}.{openshift-app-host}/standard`. If successful, you should see output similar to the following:
+
image::images/standard-shipping-cache-web-output.png[standard-shipping-cache-web-output, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Click here (in another tab) to verify our Premium shipments cache: `http://console-service-{user-username}.{openshift-app-host}/premium`.  You should see the following output:
+
image::images/premium-cache-web-output.png[premium-cache-web-output, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

[type=verification]
Were you able to successfully see output from both Standard and Premium datacache?

== Setup Grafana Dashboard

. First of all, we need to deploy the Grafana template to our namespace.  Execute the following command via the CLI *dil-* terminal:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cd /projects/FleurDeLune/projects/harvest/display

oc apply -f grafana.yaml
----
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc expose svc grafana
----

. Now that we have Grafana running, navigate back to the OpenShift Developer console and Click on grafana in the topology.  Find *Grafana* route.
+

. Login to Grafana using the credentials `admin/admin`.  If prompted to change your password, set it back to `admin` again.

. Now that you are logged into Grafana, we need to create a datasource. Click the `Add data source` link, then select **PostgreSQL**.
+
image::images/6.1.3-select-datasource.png[6.1.3-select-datasource, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. In the DataSource entry screen, enter the following:
** Name: *`SampleDB`*
** Host: *`postgresql:5432`*
** Database: *`sampledb`*
** User: *`user`*
** Password: *`password`*
** SSL Mode: *`disable`*

. Click **Save & Test**
+

. Click the **+** symbol then click **Import**.  Give the dashboard a name of `FleurDeLune`.  Navigate back to OpenShfit Dev Spaces and copy the content from `/projects/harvest/display/FleurDeLune-Dashboard.json`.  Paste the content into the Grafana JSON window then click **Import**.
+
image::images/6.1.5-load-json.png[6.1.5-load-json, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. If everything has been running correctly, you should see some Marshmallow distribution and weight metrics displayed on your graph.
+
image::images/6.1.6-graph-metrics.png[6.1.6-graph-metrics, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

[type=verification]
Were you able to successfully view the FleurDeLune metrics?

[type=verificationFail]
Verify that you followed each step in the procedure above. If you are still having issues, contact your administrator.

== Summary

In this lab you exposed inventory data via RestDSL, cached data from a Data Lake using InfiniSpan, then graphed the results using live data metrics in Grafana.

Open source connectors enable integrations with your local systems landscape. Explore InfiniSpan, Camel-K, and Grafana to connect APIs and services for event-driven application architectures (EDA). Red Hat offers supported versions of these connectors via Fuse and DataGrid.

You can now proceed to link:{next-lab-url}[Lab 4].
